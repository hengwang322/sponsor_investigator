# Sponsor Investigator: Frontend

## Set up environmental varible
To start, you need to specify the backend API endpoint as an environmental varible `REACT_APP_SPONSOR_API`. To set it 
up locally, create an `.env` file in the frontend directory and store the varible there. 

## Start app in development mode
In the frontend directory, you can run:

    yarn
    yarn start
